# TREC Deep Learning Quick Start

This is a quick start tutorial to the document ranking task from TREC Deep Learning track (see details on [2019](https://microsoft.github.io/TREC-2019-Deep-Learning) and [2020](https://microsoft.github.io/TREC-2020-Deep-Learning/) editions of the track).

More documentation is coming soon.

In the meantime, please clone the repo and run ```python run.py```. The script should download all necessary data files, if missing which can take significant amount of time depending on network speed. So, please be patient and if the download fails for any particular file then please delete the local incomplete copy of the file and re-run the script. After the download completes, the script should train a simple neural document ranking model (NDRM) and report metrics on the TREC 2019 test set for the document reranking task.
