# TREC Deep Learning Quick Start

This is a quick start guide for the document ranking task in the TREC Deep Learning (TREC-DL) track benchmark.
If you are new to TREC-DL, then this repository may make it more convenient for you to download all the required datasets and then train and evaluate an efficient deep neural baseline on this benchmark, under both the rerank and the fullrank settings.

If you are unfamiliar with the TREC-DL benchmark, then you may want to first go through the websites and overview paper corresponding to previous and current editions of the track.
* TREC-DL 2019: [website](https://microsoft.github.io/TREC-2019-Deep-Learning) and [overview paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07820.pdf)
* TREC-DL 2020: [website](https://microsoft.github.io/TREC-2020-Deep-Learning/) (Currently open for submissions!)

### DISCLAIMER
While I and some of the other contributors to this repository are also serving as organizers for TREC-DL, please note that this is *NOT* in any way an official pipeline for the track.
Instead, this is a personal codebase that I have been using for my own experimentation and am releasing it publicly with the hope that it may be useful for others who are just starting out with this benchmark.

As with any research code, you may find some kinks or bugs.
Please report any and all bugs and issues you discover, and I will try to get to them as soon as possible.
If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:bmitra@microsoft.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UnderdogGeek).

Also, please be aware that I may frequently push new changes and updates to the model based on personal research and experimentation.


## The Conformer-Kernel Model with Query Term Independence (QTI)

The baseline model implements the Conformer-Kernel architecture with QTI, as described in this [paper]().

## Requirements

## Getting Started

Please clone the repo and run ```python run.py```.
The script should download all necessary data files, if missing, which can take significant amount of time depending on network speed.
So, please be patient and if the download fails for any particular file then please delete the local incomplete copy of the file and re-run the script.
After the download completes, the script should train a simple neural document ranking model (NDRM) and report metrics on the TREC 2019 test set for the document reranking task.
